# Medical-Equipment-Projects
A curated collection of hands-on projects from my Medical Equipment course, exploring the design and simulation of real-world biomedical systems. From smart incubators with sensor integration to hemodialysis flow modeling, each project blends clinical insight with embedded systems, electronics, and control theory.
